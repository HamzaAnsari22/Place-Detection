# Place-Detection
This project will be providing building detection service through machine learning algorithm, this Android based app will be capable of detecting buildings and provide user with some historic and basic information about the building, it will also be providing a route to the detected building which the user wants to search about using Google Map. Users just have to upload the picture of the building that they want to find and this app will provide all the relevant data about it, without the hassle of searching it manually.

There are multiple outcomes of this project.

•	Allow users to get a tourist recommendation about the building they are searching for.

•	Improved ability of non-literate and out of school and work young people to search about the building easily.

•	Provides the facility of Google map by which user can get an idea of estimated path of their respective destination.
